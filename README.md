# The Joomla 4 Component Tutorial

This repository holds the code examples used in the 
[Joomla 4 Component Tutorial](https://docs.joomla.org/J4.x:Developing_an_MVC_Component). 
The tutorial is currently under construction, so this repository will update as new pages are added. 
Each section of the tutorial is given its own tag in this repository, that matches the version number
in the component's manifest file.

If you update the tutorial in the wiki, please submit a pull request with the matching code changes.
It is important to keep them both in sync, for new developers.
